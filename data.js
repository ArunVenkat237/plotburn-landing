        "overview": "An MI7 agent who grew up in England gets sent to Goa to rescue a scientist. He speaks broken Hindi so badly that saying 'tum' accidentally summons a bald white guy named Tom. The movie runs entirely on accent jokes, morse code chai slurps, and the bold assumption that mispronouncing words is a two-hour premise. Vir Das directed himself into a spy comedy where the espionage is optional and the chaos is mandatory.",
        "roast": "They built an entire movie around a guy saying Hindi words wrong, then acted surprised when half the audience walked out. The concept is incredible: what if James Bond couldn't pronounce basic nouns and that somehow solved crimes? Fans who love absurdist comedy are having a blast watching a chef-turned-spy trigger international incidents through grammar errors. They're calling it satirical brilliance, which is what we say when a movie is weird on purpose. Meanwhile, everyone else is gently noting that one running gag stretched across two hours is just a very long sketch. The critics are handing out mixed scores while admitting the story went missing somewhere between the chai slurps and the Sanjeev Kapoor cameo. We all agreed that watching someone butcher a language counts as espionage now, and honestly, that's commitment to the bit.",

He's supposed to gather intelligence, but the movie gets distracted by gang wars, election drama, and brooding for 214 minutes. It's marketed as espionage but plays like The Godfather decided to wear a patriotic badge. The film ends without resolving anything because there's a sequel coming.",
        "roast": "The filmmakers promised us a spy thriller and delivered a mafia movie wearing a disguise. They sent an agent to dismantle terror networks, then got so fascinated by gangster politics that they forgot why he was there. For nearly four hours, we watch turf wars and election rivalries while the actual spy stuff happens off-screen. It's like ordering coffee and getting a history lecture about beans instead. Audiences are thrilled because the violence looks expensive and everyone's brooding beautifully. They sat through three and a half hours and wanted more, which says something about our collective patience. Critics are gently noting that the espionage part went missing somewhere around hour two. The movie ends by saying 'Part 2 coming soon,' which is the cinematic equivalent of homework you promise to finish later. Nobody knows where the spy plot went, but the gangsters are having a great time.",

Except we have zero details about what actually happens because the movie is so new it's still in shrink wrap. The promotional team is out here calling it one of the year's best films in January, which is like declaring victory at the starting line. Fans of the web series are probably excited to see their favorite hostel chaos on a big screen, which is sweet. Meanwhile, the rest of us are wondering if a haunted dorm room really needs two hours and popcorn. The director already made a TV movie version in 2020, so this is technically a remake of his own homework. That's commitment to the bit.",

Some folks on Reddit are genuinely baffled that anyone is celebrating the 'message' here, as if infidelity needed a rebrand. Critics are handing out 2.5 stars like participation medals for showing up. The second half drags so hard you could use it to plow a field.

        "overview": "Three brothers in Fort Kochi turn their childhood obsession with wrestling into an underground WWE-style promotion featuring ex-convicts, masked fights, and ego battles. They stage dramatic bouts that mirror real-life conflicts, complete with costumes and theatrics. One brother is asthmatic but takes on the biggest event anyway. Critics want a story; audiences just want body slams.",
        "roast": "The filmmakers watched WWE as kids and decided to make it everyone's problem as adults. They built an entire movie around guys in costumes pretending to fight, then forgot to add a reason for us to care. It's all entrance music and slow-motion punches with zero emotional stakes. The asthmatic kid wrestling in the main event is peak 'we need drama but don't know how to write it.' Fans are thrilled because the action looks expensive and Mammootty shows up to wink at the camera. They're calling it a popcorn entertainer, which is code for 'my brain was off and I had fun.' Critics are gently noting that style without substance is just a really long music video. Meanwhile, the movie treats underground wrestling like it's saving the world when it's really just dudes in spandex settling beef. The energy is there, the story went home early.",

        "roast": "Someone watched a zombie movie and thought, 'You know what this needs? A pyramid of skulls and a therapy subplot.' Ralph Fiennes is living in a bone castle he apparently constructed by himself, which raises so many questions the movie refuses to answer. We're supposed to accept that one guy collected 5,500 skulls, attached 150,000 bones to posts, and built a memorial while zombies wandered around outside. Sure! Audiences are calling it profound because it's about grief and humanity, which is what we say when a horror movie makes us sad instead of scared. Some people walked in expecting zombies and walked out humming show tunes, confused but entertained. The critics are handing out great scores while admitting the plot is deliberately vague and frustrating. They're praising the 'refusal to follow genre formulas,' which is a fancy way of saying the movie does whatever it wants and dares you to complain. The train scene is apparently so shocking that people can't stop typing in all caps about it. We're all just nodding along to philosophical horror now.",

Fans are calling it hilarious garbage, which is the nicest way to say 'I laughed at all the wrong parts.' Critics are mourning the wasted potential of the captivity theme, as if this movie ever had a chance. Meanwhile, actual orca trainers are furious on Reddit because apparently we needed another reason to fear whales after Blackfish already did the work. The movie ends with an empty chair at a cello concert, which is how the audience felt: emotionally vacant but vaguely sad about wasting 89 minutes.",

What follows is two hours of world-weary cops staring at money while their brotherhood dissolves in slow motion. It's a moral quandary stretched across 113 minutes of moody lighting and overly long shootouts.",
        "roast": "Netflix spent $100 million to watch Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have a trust fall in the worst possible way. The premise is simple: cops find cash, cops get weird about cash. That's it. That's the whole movie. The filmmakers treated this like a Greek tragedy when it's really just 'what if we made staring at money dramatic?' Fans are happy because the duo still has chemistry, even if the script doesn't know what to do with it. They're praising the 'gripping tension' while ignoring that the tension is just people being suspicious for 113 minutes straight. Critics are handing out decent scores because Damon and Affleck showed up and tried, which apparently counts as a win in 2026. Meanwhile, the action scenes drag on so long you could take a nap and wake up to the same explosion. The movie wants to be a hard-hitting crime drama, but it's really just a very expensive therapy session about whether money ruins friendships. Spoiler: it does.",

        "overview": "Sita gets abandoned, deceived, and wounded by everyone around her. Then she rises from pain to power, silence to strength. It's a drama-thriller about personal redemption after betrayal. A Malayalam director made his Tamil debut with this transformative journey, and the universe responded with complete silence at the box office.",
        "roast": "The filmmakers crafted an entire empowerment arc and released it into the void. Sita goes from victim to victor, and approximately seventeen people showed up to witness it. Someone gave this a 9.5 rating, which is incredible because finding actual audience reactions is like searching for Bigfoot. The synopsis promises a woman rising with pride, but the theaters were so empty you could hear your own thoughts echoing. This is what happens when you make a serious drama about betrayal and transformation but forget to tell anyone it exists. The movie completed its hero's journey. The marketing team never started theirs.",
